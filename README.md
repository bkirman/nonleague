The Game is functional to a 0.1 standard now, and fairly stable.

You can choose rituals, run matches, see results.

A few bugs that would be good to fix:

- If the season ends, the game crashes. We should figure out a way to have a game over screen (final placement etc, restart)


and tasks in priority
- Adding Conor's messages to the news item screen (PlayerMatchResult)
- Graphics
- An animation or pause before releasing score.
- Save/load would be nice for the GameState class.
