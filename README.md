Non-League Football Supporter

At the moment, when you compile and run it, it does Main Activity. This is like an example that runs some stuff to show the simulation.
Effectively the sequence of events simulates the running of a league.
Teams are invented based on Conor's name algorithm
Teams are assigned fixtures

At the bottom it runs an effective league (loop nextfixture), then prints a league table to the log.

There is something funky going on somewhere, however it doesn't matter just yet. Results are generated, for matches, that runs a league.

next we need to figure out a way for the player to have a team and that it pauses at these moments. And a whole user interface... if anything the user interface is a good bit to focus on.
