Non-League Football Supporter - GDX edition
=========
This branch contains a rewrite of Non-League Football Supporter to use the multi-platform LibGDX framework.

The branch is currently **semi-functional**. Please refer to the master branch of the project for a functional native Android implementation.

Outstanding Tasks
------------------
- MatchView is currently skipped for debug purposes. Check the flag in MatchView
- Seasons end, new leagues are all generated nicely, but it needs an interstitial screen to summarise team season results.
- General beautification throughout

Bugs
----
- See Issues system on Github

Compiling
---------
NLFS-GDX uses Gradle. Make sure to set the path to the Android SDK in local.properties (sdk.dir=/home/blah) to compile the Android version (or disable it in the settings). We've been using Eclipse with ADT for Android, but your own gradle-supported IDE should work.
